# Hobby OS Project

This is a personal project aimed at deepening my understanding of **operating system concepts** through a practical, hands-on approach.

## Current Features (Early Development)

- **GDT**
- **IDT**
- **Serial**
- **VGA**
- **Memory Management**
- **PS/2 Keyboard Input**
- **Virtual Filesystem**
- **CLI Commands**
  - `ls`: **List files and directories**
  - `mfile`: **Create a file**
  - `clear`: **Clear the console**

## Work in Progress

### Adding More CLI Commands

- Extending the shell with useful commands.
- Working on EXT2 File system type

## Project Goals

- **Learn and implement core OS concepts**
- **Implement Character Rendering**
- **Implement Graphic Drivers**
- **Focusing on low-level programming, system calls, and hardware interaction.**
- **Hands-on experience with OS internals**
- **By building and debugging features like memory management, process scheduling, and filesystems.**

## Getting Started

**To run the OS locally:**

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tushar1977/custom_os
   cd custom_os
   ./run_os.sh
   ```
