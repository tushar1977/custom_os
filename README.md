# Hobby OS Project

This is a personal project aimed at deepening my understanding of **operating system concepts** through a practical, hands-on approach.

## Current Features (Early Development)

- **Memory Management**  
- **PS/2 Keyboard Input**  
- **Virtual Filesystem**  
- **CLI Commands**  
  - `ls`: **List files and directories**  
  - `mfile`: **Create a file**  
  - `clear`: **Clear the console**  

## Work in Progress

### Adding More CLI Commands  
Extending the shell with useful commands.

## Project Goals
- **Learn and implement core OS concepts**
- **Focusing on low-level programming, system calls, and hardware interaction.**
- **Hands-on experience with OS internals**
- **By building and debugging features like memory management, process scheduling, and filesystems.**

## Getting Started

**To run the OS locally:**

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tushar1977/custom_os
   cd custom_os
   ./run_os.sh
